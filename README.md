### Problem it Solves:

The Myntra clone app, created with HTML and CSS, aims to provide a practical learning experience for web development enthusiasts. 
It serves as a valuable exercise to improve HTML and CSS skills by replicating a popular e-commerce platform's user interface.

### What I Learned: 

During the development of this Myntra clone, I gained hands-on experience in structuring web pages using HTML and styling them using CSS.
I learned about responsive design principles to adapt the layout for various screen sizes. Additionally, this project helped me understand
the importance of attention to detail in mimicking the design of a complex web application.
